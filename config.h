// Try to write down the two axis of every joystick with the corresponding pin numbers you chose. (A4 and A5 are not used in the example by TeachingTech).
// Compile the script, type 1 into the serial interface and hit enter to enable debug output 1.
// Now: At the joystick in front of you (A), move the joystick from top to bottom (X). 
// If everything is correct: The debug output for AX should show values from 0 to 1023.
// If another output is showing this values, swap them. Probably you have to swap the first and second element, as AX and AY may be swapped.
// If you have the joystick TeachingTech recommended: 
//     The pins labelled X and Y on the joystick are NOT the X and Y needed here, but swapped. First joysticks Y: AX and X: AY. 
// 
// Repeat this with every axis and every joystick.

// 1: Output raw joystick values. 0-1023 raw ADC 10-bit values
// 2: Output centered joystick values. Values should be approx -500 to +500, jitter around 0 at idle.
// 20: semi-automatic min-max calibration
// 3: Output centered joystick values. Filtered for deadzone. Approx -350 to +350, locked to zero at idle, modified with a function.
// 4: Output translation and rotation values. Approx -350 to +350 depending on the parameter.
// 5: Output debug 4 and 5 side by side for direct cause and effect reference.
// 6: Report velocity and keys after possible kill-key feature
// 7: Report the frequency of the loop() -> how often is the loop() called in one second?

// Modifier Function
// Modify resulting behaviour of Joystick input values
// DISCLAIMER: This should be at level 0 when starting the calibration
// 0: linear y = x [Standard behaviour: No modification]
// 1: squared function y = x^2*sign(x) [altered squared function working in positive and negative direction]
// 2: tangent function: y = tan(x) [Results in a flat curve near zero but increases the more you are away from zero]
// 3: squared tangent function: y = tan(x^2*sign(X)) [Results in a flatter curve near zero but increases alot the more you are away from zero]
// 4: cubed tangent function: y = tan(x^3) [Results in a very flat curve near zero but increases drastically the more you are away from zero]
#define MODFUNC 4

// Second calibration: Tune Deadzone
// Deadzone to filter out unintended movements. Increase if the mouse has small movements when it should be idle or the mouse is too senstive to subtle movements.
// Set debug = 2. Don't touch the mouse but observe the values. They should be nearly to zero. Every value around zero which is noise or should be neglected afterwards is in the following deadzone.
#define DEADZONE 5  // Recommended to have this as small as possible for V2 to allow smaller knob range of motion.

// Third calibration: getting min and max values
// Can be done manual (debug = 2) or semi-automatic (debug = 20)
// Semi-automatic (debug=20)
// 1. Set debug = 20
// 2. Compile the sketch, upload it and wait for confirmation in the serial console.
// 3. Move the spacemouse around for 15s to get a min and max value.
// 4. Verify, that the minimums are around -400 to -520 and the maxVals around +400 to +520.
// (repeat or check again, if you have small values!)
// 5. Copy the output from the console into your config.h (below the manual instructions)

// Manual min/max calibration (debug = 2)
// Recommended calibration procedure for min/max adc levels
// 1. Change debug to level 2 and upload sketch. Then open Serial Monitor.
// 2. Get a piece of paper and write the following chart:
// Chart:
//  maxVals      | minVals
//--------------------------------
//  AX+:         | AX-:
//  AY+:         | AY-:
//  BX+:         | BY-:

//  CY+:         | CY-:
//  DX+:         | DY-:
//  DY+:         | DY-:
//
// 3. (a) Start out with AX (positive Values)
//    (b) Start moving the your spacemouse and try increasing the Value of AX till you can't get a higher value out of it.
//    (c) this is your positive maximum value for AX so write it down for AX
//4. Do the same for AY,BX,BY,....DY
// 5. Do the same for your negative Values to populate the minVals
// 6. Write all the positive Values starting from the top into the Array maxValues
// 7. Write all the negative Values starting from the top into the Array minValues
// 8. You finished calibrating.

// Insert measured Values like this: {AX,AY,BX,BY,CY,CY,DX,DY}.
#define MINVALS { -486, -475, -480, -490, -488, -481, -483, -473 };
#define MAXVALS { +481, +492, +486, +478, +479, +487, +484, +494 };

// Fourth calibration: Sensitivity
// Independent sensitivity multiplier for each axis movement. Use degbug mode 4 or use for example your cad program to verify changes.
// eg use lower value like 0.5 to make axis more sensitive, use higher value like 5 to make it less sensitive
// The Values you can change (those Values worked for me, you can or should change them to your preferences):

// Recommended calibration procedure for sensitivity
//  1. Make sure modFunc is on level 0!! Change debug to level 4 and upload sketch. Then open Serial Monitor. You will see Values TX, TY, TZ, RX, RY, RZ
//  2. Start moving your spacemouse. You will notice values changing.
//  3. Starting with TX try increasing this value as much as possible by moving your spacemouse around. If you get around 350 thats great. If not change pos_transX_sensitivy and reupload sketch. Repeat until it is around 350 for maximum motion.
//  4. Repeat steps 3 for TY,TZ,RX,RY,RZ
//  5. Verification: Move the Jockstick in funny ways. All you should get for eather TX,TX,TZ,RX,RY,RZ should be aprox. between -350 to 350.
//  6. You have finished sensitivity calibration. You can now test your spacemouse with your favorite program (e.g. Cad software, Slicer)
//  7. Aftermath: You notice the movements are hard to control. Try using Modification Functions (have a look at the beginning of the sketch) [I like level 3 the most. Experiment to find your favorite function]
